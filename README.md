CityVisualizerVR
================

- Overview


The City Visualizer Prototype is an exercise in the potential new types of map viewing and navigation available with the Leap Motion Controller.  The purpose is to explore an interface that allows a user to move, rotate, and zoom a 3d map solely with the tracking and gestures provided with the 2.0+ SDK provided by Leap Motion.

- Controls

Use a ONE-HANDED GRAB GESTURE to pan around the scene.  Panning is controlled like a flight stick: the further offset from the sweet spot, the faster the movement in that direction.  The GRAB GESTURE is signified on the hand by the entire hand turning red.

Use a TWO-HANDED PINCH GESTURE or a TWO-HANDED GRAB GESTURE to manipulate the transform gyro.  When holding the transform gyro, bringing your hands together will zoom out, bringing them apart will zoom in, and movement will control tilt and rotation.  Note that you can manipulate the gryo by grabbing either of the two opposite sides.  The PINCH GESTURE is signified on the hand by the index finger and thumb turning green.

FLIP ONE HAND OVER, palm up, to active the Options Menu.  While the Options Menu is visible, use your extended INDEX FINGER on the opposite hand to control the sliders on the menu.  The top slider controls the time of day, while the bottom slider adjusts the current Layer of the map.  Layers include: Standard Map, "Live" tweets, and a Crime heat map.  

[Note that these layers are for demonstration only, the tweets are not actually live and that is not an actual crime heat map.]
